# 🔍 Climate Visualization Discussion: *How High Will Global Heating Go?*

**Source**: [The Guardian – May 8, 2024](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/08/world-scientists-climate-failure-survey-global-temperature)  
**Visualization**: Guardian graphic based on 380 IPCC climate expert survey responses  
**Focus**: Projected global temperature rise by 2100 (above pre-industrial levels)

## 1. 📊 What data are visualized?

- **Type**: Survey data from 380 IPCC climate scientists.
- **Question**: *“By how much do you expect average global temperature to rise above pre-industrial levels by 2100?”*
- **Data Bins**:
  - Below 1.5°C  
  - 1.5°C  
  - 2.0°C  
  - 2.5°C  
  - 3.0°C  
  - 3.5°C  
  - 4.0°C  
  - 4.5°C  
  - 5.0°C or above
- **Visual Encoding**: One red square = one scientist's answer.

- The visual shows the distribution of expert opinions on expected global temperature rise from a survey of 380 climate scientists

---

## 2. 🎯 What does the visualization aim to communicate?

- The vast majority of climate experts (77%) expect a **temperature rise of at least 2.5°C**.
- The **1.5°C goal from the Paris Agreement** is considered largely out of reach.
- The visualization highlights a **consensus of concern** about future global heating.
- It implicitly warns of the **urgent need for stronger action** on emissions.

---

## 3. ✅ What aspects of the visualization do you appreciate?

- **Intuitive layout**: Binned bar chart is easy to interpret.
- **Individual granularity**: Each square = one response gives a human-scale feel.
- **Clear takeaway**: The “77%” annotation summarizes the key message quickly.
- **Clean, minimalist design**: Focus remains on the data.
- **Color use**: Consistent red highlights the seriousness of the topic.

---

## 4. ⚠️ What aspects do you find problematic?

- **No y-axis labels**: Makes estimating actual counts harder.
- **Ambiguity in bin definitions**: Unclear whether 2.5°C means "exactly" or a range.
- **Lack of uncertainty information**: No confidence intervals or spread shown.
- **Missing demographic context**: No info on respondents’ regions, fields, etc.
- **Accessibility concerns**: Red-only color may be difficult for colorblind users.
- **Lack of historical comparison**: No insight into how expert opinion has shifted over time.

---

## 5. 🛠 How can the visualization be improved?

- Add **y-axis scale** or total count labels.
- Clarify **bin ranges** (e.g., 2.0–2.5°C instead of just “2.5°C”).
- Include **confidence intervals** or a second chart for response distribution.
- Add **reference line** at 1.5°C to represent the Paris Agreement target.
- Introduce **accessible design** (colorblind-friendly patterns or textures).
- Provide **demographic filters** or metadata about expert backgrounds.

## 6. 🌍 Are the data publicly available, or are there suitable surrogate data?

- The Guardian survey results are **not publicly available** in raw form.
- However, suitable **open data sources** include:
  - [IPCC Reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/)
  - [NASA GISS Climate Data](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/)
  - [NOAA Climate.gov](https://www.climate.gov/)
  - [Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/)
- These sources offer **model projections** and **historical temperature datasets** that could be used to replicate or extend the analysis.
